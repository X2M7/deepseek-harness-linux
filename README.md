# DeepSeek Harness for Linux

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness for Linux is a community desktop port of [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), the open-source agent harness (`dsh`) developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com). This independently maintained project adds Linux desktop packaging; it is not an official DeepSeek release.

Start with the [Linux desktop guide](apps/desktop/README.md#linux-desktop) for prerequisites, development, AppImage, Debian, and RPM packages, and manual updates. Report Linux port issues in [this repository](https://github.com/X2M7/deepseek-harness-linux/issues).

It is built on an **everything-is-a-plugin** architecture and powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512).

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is in _developer preview_ and iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

Review the [safety notice](SAFETY.md) before running the project.

## Run

### Run the upstream Web application from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens it in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To launch the Linux desktop application from this repository, first complete the prerequisites in the [Linux desktop guide](apps/desktop/README.md#linux-desktop):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/X2M7/deepseek-harness-linux.git
cd deepseek-harness-linux
pnpm install
pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec install-electron
pnpm run dev:desktop
```

`pnpm run dev:desktop` builds the application before launching it. The desktop guide also covers packaging and reusing an existing build.

## Community and support

- Report Linux desktop issues in [this repository](https://github.com/X2M7/deepseek-harness-linux/issues); discuss the upstream harness through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions).
- Add the [`dsh-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) topic to your plugin repository for discoverability.
- Join <a href="https://discord.gg/4MrtZUhpxg">DeepSeek Harness Discord community</a>.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

Start with the [development guide](docs/development.md) and [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md).

`pnpm run dev:web` builds, serves, and rebuilds client bundles on source edits in one terminal, and `make help` lists the matching Make targets for Web and Desktop; the guide's application commands section owns the full table.
